# Welcome to RandomDAO git repository

This project aim to initiate a fully-decentralized randomness service that serves decentralized applications.



## On-Chain Randomness
Can be used by on-chain applications such as DeFI, gaming, social etc.

The issue of on-chain randomness is that it cannot be generated by EVM, the reason is that node operators then can control random outcomes hence can pick non-random values as random. [On-chain randomness intro](https://media.dedaub.com/bad-randomness-is-even-dicier-than-you-think-7fa2c6e0c2cd).

Currently there exists centralized solutions only such as [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction/) service.

## RandomDAO Solution

RandomDAO is a platform for generating random numbers (aka randomness) by collabarating huge number of "randomness operators", which are individuals that are feeding the RandomDAO smart contract by random numbers (aka randomness).


## RandomDAO Network
RandomDAO forming as a network of independant (unrelated) individuals, which its main logic is to give any individual, have access to internet, an equal opportunities to get incentives by using PoW fasion network, in exchange for an on-chain feeding by random numbers.

RandomDAO creates an exchange for randomness feeds in order to attract many undependant individuals as much is possible, where all individuals have the same chances to be feeders for each block.

As long the RandomDAO network will be bigger the randomness outcome will be much "random".

## Random Coin

Is an ERC20 token that is minted, by an automated smart contract, for every randomness feeded by an individual. Once a random numbers (as a feed) verified by RandomDAO smart contract it mint new coins for the feeder (individual).

RandomDAO smart contract produces competition between operators to give the 

RandomDAO 

## Consumers
Are on-chain applications (or smart contracts) that operates automated actions based on randomness. Access made through RandomDAO's smart contract and allowed only for consumers that had active staking of Random Coin.
